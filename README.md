# AsTKoids

### Overview

AsTKoids is a very simple [2.5D][25dgame] space game freely inspired to the classic Asteroids. A spaceship (the 3D model is a custom design from blender adapted for the game) has to avoid or shoot down several asteroids coming at player from different directions. The ship has several cannons it can fire lasers from, but they can only fire when the target is under their reach: for example, when shooting from the front of the ship, only front cannons will fire. The player is challenged not only to survive, but also to find the best orientation for the spaceship to fire at targets and be more effective.

### Bit of history

Game is written in C# and OpenGL, using the [OpenTK][OpenTK] library and a very basic 3D Engine called [SevenEngine][SevenEngine], which I extended with new functionalities such as **object parenting** and specialized its classes with OpenGL types (it was easier for me to use Quaternion native types, even though the purpose of the engine was to keep itself generic).

This work was made as an academic project, subsequent to a modeling and rendering part, from which the spaceship model was downscaled from. Other models and textures are retrieved from the web since they are used in a non-commercial application (moon surface has still its watermark on it for instance).

Visual Studio 2013 was used to build the project and solution file (.sln) is provided. You may use the attached folder "SevenEngine" as a separate project as well, but keep in mind this is a custom version of the original engine, which could suit your needs best (and also contains good tutorials to learn how to use it).

### Build

Nothing hard really, just open .sln file and build. Needed .dll files are in "References" folder in SevenEngine. For more details, read comments in both game (AsTKoids) and engine (SevenEngine) projects code.

### Usage

Each asteroid destroyed will score points. Beware: they bounce with each other and split in two smaller ones when destroyed (up to 2 times).

Commands are always on screen (since project was supposed to be shown as a demo for academic purposes), except one that is hidden because experimental:
- **W,A,S,D** = move spaceship around (only its translation on a 2D plane)
- **Mouse Move** = move crosshair / re-orient spaceship
- **Mouse LEFT** = fire
- **Mouse RIGHT** = Set Yaw. If this is pressed, spaceship orientation won't follow crosshair movements anymore. This is crucial to move while keeping position (es. while attacking)
- **C key** [Hidden] = WASD can now pan camera in 3D
- **ESC** = Exit game
